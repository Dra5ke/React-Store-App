# Electronics Store React App demo

## Demo that uses React and Json server as a dummy database with a few electronic products in it
The app displays a list of products that you can add to a shopping basket. The number of each item that was added to the basket is displayed on each product.
A separate view is created using react-router-dom to display the basket. In there you can see the total price and remove whatever items you wish.

## How to run the project
After cloning the repo you will need two separate terminals

1. In the first terminal run the script `npm run server`
2. In the second terminal run the script `npm run start`

This will run the app in development mode
